## Model-Based Design

> "Everything that can be controlled needs to be mathematically quantified."

Model-based design (MBD) is a mathematical and visual method of addressing problems associated with designing complex control, signal processing and communication systems. It is used in many motion control, industrial equipment, aerospace, and automotive applications. Model-based design is a methodology applied in designing embedded software.

Model-based deisgn plays a very important role in the most stages of system development. Such as Model & Simulation, SIL, HIL and so on. The model-based design makes it easier to comply with V-Model development process which helps create a safer and more reliable system.
