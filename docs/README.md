# Introduction

> An advanced autopilot system designed for Model-Based Design.

## What is Firmament?

Firmament (FMT) is an advanced autopilot system which is develop for Model-Based Design (MBD). FMT mainly consists of two parts.

- [FMT-Firmware](https://github.com/Firmament-Autopilot/FMT-Firmware): A stable and high performance embedded system designed with C/C++.
- [FMT-Model](https://github.com/Firmament-Autopilot/FMT-Model): A simulation framework and algorithm library designed with MATLAB/Simulink.

## Motivation

Model-based design provides an efficient approach for establishing a complex and safe control system. It has been widely used in many industries, primarily in the automotive and aerospace sectors. Currently there is no open-source autopilot system which is designed with Model-based design and FMT-Autopilot is born to this. FMT provides an ideal platform to develop and test your own state-of-the-art algorithm and deploy it on various hardware. FMT provides powerful simulation capability which makes it much easier to debug and optimize your software.

## Why Firmament?

- Higher development efficency with model-based deisign and debug easier.
- A stable and high performance embedded system designed with C/C++.
- A powerful simulation framework designed with MATLAB/Simulink.
- Auto code generation from Simulink model.
- Excellent real-time performance based on RT-Thread RTOS with active community and large number of third-party components.
- Support with most widely used open-source hardware Pixhawk (Both FMUv2 and FMUv5 are supported).
- Cross-platform toolchain which support Windows/Linux/Mac.
- Support with mavlink v1.0/v2.0.
